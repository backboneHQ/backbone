# Backbone

Backbone is a system to provide the core infrastructure for the pipeline. It has been built from the ground up with scalability and multi-facility architecture in mind. On the usability side backbone provides series of abstraction layers to help developers & artists to work in an immutable environment where developers can safely develop on sandbox and artists can safely be isolated from specific releases by providing multiple deployment streams (Canary releases). 

On backbone, all resources are treated equally. Therefore, configurations, plugins, scripts, tools, apps (etc) are versioned & handled in the same matter.
