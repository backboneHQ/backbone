# Backbone

Backbone is a system to provide the core infrastructure for the pipeline. It has been built from the ground up with scalability and multi-facility architecture in mind. On the usability side backbone provides series of abstraction layers to help developers & artists to work through an environment where developers can safely develop on sandbox and artists can safely be isolated from specific releases by allowing multiple deployment streams (Canary release). 

On backbone, all resources are treated equally. Therefore, configurations, plugins, scripts, tools, apps (etc) are versioned & handled in the same matter.

This project is divided in separated repos where each repo is responsible for a specific section of the core infrastructure:
- [bbase](https://github.com/backboneHQ/bbase)
- [bsys](https://github.com/backboneHQ/bsys)
- [bevents](https://github.com/backboneHQ/bevents)
- [bver](https://github.com/backboneHQ/bver)
- [blauncher](https://github.com/backboneHQ/blauncher)
